# Analog Deadzone for Controller Analog Sticks (X and Y axes)
# Value range: 0.0 to 0.5 (0.0 = no deadzone, 0.1 = 10% deadzone, etc.)
# Each player can have a different deadzone value configured independently.
# This only applies to analog stick inputs (X and Y axes).
# Does not affect guns, rotary controllers, or other input types.
# Examples:
#   ANALOG_DEADZONE_PLAYER_1 0.1   # Player 1 has 10% deadzone
#   ANALOG_DEADZONE_PLAYER_2 0.15  # Player 2 has 15% deadzone
#   ANALOG_DEADZONE_PLAYER_3 0.05  # Player 3 has 5% deadzone
#   ANALOG_DEADZONE_PLAYER_4 0.0   # Player 4 has no deadzone
